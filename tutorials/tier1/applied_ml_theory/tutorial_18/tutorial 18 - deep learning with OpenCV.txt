Deep Learning with OpenCV

openCV 3.3 contains a highly improved deep learning module (dnn)

Module supports a number of deep learning frameworks including Caffe, TensorFlow, and Torch/PyTorch

The API for using pre-trained models is compatible with both the C++ API and the Python bindings

	1) load a model from disk
	2) Pre-process an input image
	3) Pass the image through the network and obtain the output classifications
	
We cannot train deep learning models using OpenCV

We can take our models trained using dedicated deep learning libraries/tools and then efficiently use them direclty inside our OpenCV
