Tutorial 5-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LeNet - Convolutional Neural Network in Python

Today we are going to implement our first Convolutional Neural Network

We will implement the LeNet architecture using Python and Keras

This tutorial will be primarily code oriented and meant to help you get your feet wet with Deep learning and convolutional neural networks

Not going to spend much detail on activation functions, pooling layers, or dense/fully connected layers

We will look at gory details later on

We will use the MNIST dataset

The LeNet architecture
	
	An excellent "first architecture" for Convolutional Neurall Networks
	Small and easy to understand but large enough to provide interesting results
	
	In many ways it is the Hello World equivalent for Deep Learning for image classification
	
	INPUT -> CONV -> RELU -> POOL -> CONV -> RELU -> POOL -> FC -> RELU -> FC


Our CNN project structure
	Gives file structure
	
	Output (stores the trained network)
	Pyimagesearch
		Cnn (store our convolutional neural network implementations)
			Networks (network implementations will be stored)
				lenet
	Lenet_mnist
