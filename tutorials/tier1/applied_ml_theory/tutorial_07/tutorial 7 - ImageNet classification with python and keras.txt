ImageNet classification with Python and Keras

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/08/10/imagenet-classification-with-python-and-keras/

Francois Chollet pushed three Keras models online. These networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, meaning they can recognize 1000 common object classes out of the box

To utilize these models in your own applications
	You need to install Keras
	Download the weights files for the pre-trained network(s)
	Apply the pre-trained ImageNet networks to your own images
	
The weight files are in Caffe format

There isn't an easy or streamlined method to convert Caffe weights to a Keras-compatible model

It's now as simple as three lines of code
	Model = VGG16(weights="imagenet")
	Preds = model.predict(preprocess_input(image))
	Print(decode_prediction(preds))
	
What is ImageNet
	A project aimed at labeling and categorizing images into almost 22,000 categories based on a defined set of words and phrases
	
	ImageNet Large Scale Recognition Challenge
		This is what people are probably referring to when talking about ImageNet
		
		Goal of the image classification track in this challenge is to train a model that can classify an image into 1000 separate categories using over 100,000 test images
		
Configuring your system for Keras and Imagenet

	Pip install pillow
	
	You can pip freeze to list out the packages installed in your environment
	
Keras and Python code for ImageNet CNNs

	Just end up classifying different things
	
	Won't actually implement the code
