Questions
	What are image convolutions?
	What do they do?
	Why do we use them?
	How do we apply them?
	What role do they play in deep learning
	
You've probably already applied convolutions
	Blurring, smoothing, edge detection, sharpening are all convolution
	
Convolution is simply an element-wise multiplication of two matrices followed by a sum

Convolution
	Take two matrices
	Multiply them element by element
	Sum the elements together
	
Convolutions with Open CV and Python
	
	Intro
		Image is just a multi-dimensional matrix
		Think of image as big matrix and convolutional matrix as the tiny matrix
		
		Tiny kernel sits on top  of the big image and slides from left-to-right and top-to-bottom applying a convolution at each (x,y) coordinate of the iamge
		
	Kernels
		This is the tiny matrix
		
		Slides from left-to-right and top-to-bottom along the original image
		
		We stop and examine the neighborhood of pixels located at the center of the image kernel, and obtain a single output value, which is stored at the same x,y coordinates as the center of the kernel
		
		Kernels can be an arbitrary size M×N pixels provided that both M and N are odd integers
			This ensures that the output matrix after applying the convolution is still valid
			
	Understanding Image convolutions
		
		Requires three components
			An input image
			A kernel matrix
			Output image to store the output
			
		Steps in convolution are as descsribed above
		
	Implementing Convolutions with OpenCV and pythono
		
		We create a custom convolve method that  takes an image and a kernel
		
		Sometimes we will want our output image to have the same dimensions as our input image. To do this we apply padding. We simply replicate the pixels along the border of the image, such that the output image will match the dimensions of the input image
		
		Define different kernels
		
		And then example images
		
	The Role of Convolutions in Deep learning
		It is possible to define a machine learning algorithm that can look at images and eventually learn these types of operators
