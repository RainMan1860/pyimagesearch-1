Multi-class SVM Loss

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/09/05/multi-class-svm-loss/

A loss function is used to quantify how good or bad a given predictor is at classifying the input data points in a dataset

Smaller the loss, the better a job the classifier is at modeling the relationship between input data and output labels

Can abbreviate a scoring function as

s=f(x_i,W)

This implies that we can obtain the predicted score of the jth class via the ith data point

s_j=f(x_i,W)_j

Hinge loss function

	L_i= ?_(j?y_i)¦?max?(0,s_j-s_(y_i )+1)?

	Summing across all incorrect classes and comparing the output of our scoring function returned for the jth class label and the y_i  th class level
	
To get the loss of the entire dataset, we take the mean over each individual l_i

There  is also squared hinge loss

Example on the cats v. dogs dataset
