Deep learning: How OpenCV's blobFromImage works

To obtain (correct) predictions from deep neural networks, you first need to preprocess your data

In the context of deep learning and image classification, these preprocessing tasks normally involve:
	Mean subtraction
	Scaling by some factor
	
OpenCV blobFromImage performs
	Mean subtraction, scaling, and optionally channel swapping
	
Mean subtraction
	Used to help combat illumination changes in the input images in our dataset
	Technique used to aid our Convolutional Neural Networks
	
	We compute the average pixel intensity in the training set for each of the three channels
	
	When we are ready to pass an image through our network we subtract the mean from each input
	
Scaling Factor
	
	Adds a normalization
	
	s may be manually set or a standard deviation
	
BlobFromImage
	
	Arguments: image, scalefactor, size, mean, swapRB
