An intro to linear classification in Python

Simple linear classifier is a cornerstone building block of more advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms

4 components of parametrized learning and linear classifiers
	Data
	Score function
	Loss function
	Weight matrix
	
For linear classification we have a weights matrix and a bias vector

The only parameters we have any control of are this W and b

How weight matrix is optimized is dependent on the loss function but usually will use some form of gradient descent
	
Advantages
	After calculating the W and b, we can discard the input data
	Classifying new test data is fast because we simply have to multiply the input against W and then add the bias vector b
	
Example on the cats v. dogs dataset
