Installing Keras for deep learning

The installation procedure will show you how to install Keras

	With GPU support and Without GPU support
	
	Note: I'll make two conda environment, one for each
	
Keras is a minimalist, modulalr neural network library that can use either TensorFlor or Theano as a backend

Primary motivation of it: You should be able to experiment super quickly - going from idea to result, as fast as possible

If you're doing stuff with EC2 you probably need to use this for GPU speedup

Overall, installing Keras is a 4-step procedure
	First step (optional)
		Whether or not you would like to use Python virtual environments
		
	Second step (optional)
		Whether or not you want to use the GPU to speedup training your neural networks. Need a CUDA-compatible GPU. The Keras library can run on the CPU just fine, but if you really want to train deep neural networks, you'll want to get a GPU installation setup
		
	Third step (option)
		If you would like to have OpenCV binidings in your Python virtual environemnt with your Keras installation
		
	Fourth Step
		Installation
		
		Pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn pillow h5py
		Pip install tensorflow (this is the cpu version)
		Pip install keras
	
Even if you just have the CPU version, this will enable you to follow along in future PyImageSearch tutorials on deep learning
