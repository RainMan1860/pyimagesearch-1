Feedforward neural networks
	
	Most common architecture is the feedforward network
	
	No backwards or inter-layer connections allowed
	
	The nodes in layer i are fully connected to the nodes in layer i+1
	
	FC -> fully connected
	
Example of neural network
	
	Layer 0
		Contains inputs
		
	Layers middle 
		Hidden layers
		
	Layer n
		Output layer or visible layer

Implementing your own neural network with Python and Keras

Note:  A GPU is not needed for today's blog post - your laptop can run this very elementary network easily. That being said, in general, I do not recommend using a laptop for deep learning.  Laptops are for prodcutivity rather than working with TB sized datasets required for many deep learning activities

I recommend Amazon AWS using my preconfigured AMI or Microsoft's DVSM
